# hello-world
And another, and another, and another...

This hello-world project serves to teach me the basic in's and out's of projects/repositories on GitHub.
Built as per instructions at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/.

ReadMe's are for describing projects, laying out initial install processes, answering some FAQs, and pointing readers to further info (if applicable). 

Hooray!
